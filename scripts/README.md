# VSCode Docs

This task generates the Configuration section of the VSCode extension README.md from the package.json.

## Usage

### Update the README

```bash
pnpm run docs:update
```

This command runs the TypeScript script using Node's native type stripping feature and then formats the entire project.

## CI Verification

The CI workflow verifies the README is up-to-date by:

1. Running `pnpm run docs:update` to regenerate the configuration and format the project
2. Running `git diff --exit-code README.md` to ensure no changes were made

## How it works

1. Reads the `package.json` file
2. Extracts the configuration properties from `contributes.configuration.properties`
3. Separates them into Window and Workspace configurations based on the `scope` property
4. Generates markdown tables for each configuration type
5. Replaces the content between `<!-- START_GENERATED_CONFIGURATION -->` and `<!-- END_GENERATED_CONFIGURATION -->` markers in the README

## Features

- Includes deprecated fields in a separate section with an empty row separator
- Generates properly formatted markdown tables with Key, Default Value, Possible Values, and Description columns
- Includes FixKind enum values if referenced in any configuration
- Includes RulesCustomization section if `oxc.lint.customization` is present with per-key properties
- Sorts configuration options alphabetically for consistent output
- Uses Node 22.6+ native TypeScript type stripping (no transpilation required)
